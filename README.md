This program decrypts the messages exchanged by the fictional characters Elma
York and Nathaniel York in *The Fated Sky* by Mary Robinette Kowal.

See `york.py` for the code and instructions on how to run it.

This is a completely unofficial fan program. It contains no content copied from
the novel. (In particular, I did not include any sample messages.)
